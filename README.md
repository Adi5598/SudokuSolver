# SudokuSolver
C++ program to Solve Sudoku

Version 1.0 
We start with a brute force approach. We input a 9x9 grid from the user. For every empty square we calculate all possibilities and try each possibility. If we reach a square which does not have any possibility then we have made some error in some previous square, therefore we backtrack and find the viable solution.
